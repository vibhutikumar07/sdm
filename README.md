# CAP plugin for SAP Document Management Service
The project is currently in the development stage, where our team is actively working on building and refining its core components to ensure it meets all specified requirements and objectives.

The **@cap-java/sdm** package is [cds-plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages) that provides an easy CAP-level integration with [SAP Document Management Service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/document-management-service-integration-option). This package supports handling of attachments(documents) by using an aspect Attachments in SAP Document Management Service.  
This plugin can be consumed by the CAP application deployed on BTP to store their documents in the form of attachments in Document Management Repository.

## Key features

- Create attachment : Provides the capability to upload new attachments.
- Virus scanning : Provides the capability to support virus scan for virus scan enabled repositories.
- Draft functionality : Provides the capability of working with draft attachments.

## Pre-Requisites
* Java 17 or higher
* CAP Development Kit (`npm install -g @sap/cds-dk`)
* SAP Build WorkZone should be subscribed to view the HTML5Applications.
* [MTAR builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mbt) (`npm install -g mbt`)
* [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html), Install cf-cli and run command `cf install-plugin multiapps`.

## Deploying and testing the application

1. Log in to Cloud Foundry space:

   ```sh
   cf login -a <CF-API> -o <ORG-NAME> -s <SPACE-NAME>
   ```

2. Create a SAP Document Management Integration Option [Service instance and key](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/sap-document-management-service/creating-service-instance-and-service-key). Bind your CAP application to this SDM instance. Add the details of this instance to the resources section in the `mta.yaml` of your CAP application. Refer the following example from a sample Bookshop app.

   ```
   modules:
      - name: bookshop-srv
      type: java
      path: srv
      requires:
         - name: sdm-di-instance
  
   resources:
      - name: sdm-di-instance
      type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
      parameters:
         service: sdm
         service-plan: standard
   ```
3. Using the created SDM instance's credentials from key [onboard a repository](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/sap-document-management-service/onboarding-repository). In mta.yaml, under properties of the srv module add the repository id. Refer the following example from a sample Bookshop app. Currently only non versioned repositories are supported. 

    ```
    modules:
      - name: bookshop-srv
      type: java
      path: srv
      properties:
            REPOSITORY_ID: <REPO ID>
      requires:
         - name: sdm-di-instance
    ```

4. Add the following pom dependency in the _srv_ folder
   
   ```sh
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
      <artifactId>sdm</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

5. In the _app/index.html_ file you will find this line 
   ```sh
      <script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" src="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
   ```
   Replace the src url with this instead
   ```sh
      "https://sapui5nightly.int.sap.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
   ```

6. Add the following facet in _fiori-service.cds_ in the _app_ folder
   ```sh
      {
         $Type : 'UI.ReferenceFacet',
         ID     : 'AttachmentsFacet',
         Label : '{i18n>attachments}',
         Target: 'attachments/@UI.LineItem'
      }
   ```

7. Build the project by running following command from root folder of your CAP application
   ```sh
   mbt build
   ```
   Above step will generate .mtar file inside mta_archives folder.

8. Deploy the application
   ```sh
   cf deploy mta_archives/*.mtar
   ```

9. Go to your BTP subaccount and launch your application.

10. The `Attachments` type will generate an out-of-the-box Attachments table.

## Use @cap-java/sdm plugin

**To use sdm plugin in your CAP application, create an element with an `Attachments` type.** Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), create a separate file _srv/attachment-extension.cds_ and extend your entity with attachments. Refer the following example from a sample Bookshop app:

```
using {my.bookshop.Books } from '../db/books';
using {sap.attachments.Attachments} from`com.sap.cds/sdm`;
 
extend entity Books with {
    attachments : Composition of many Attachments;
}
```

## Known Restrictions

- Repository : This plugin does not support the use of versioned repositories.
- File size : Attachments are limited to a maximum size of 100 MB.
